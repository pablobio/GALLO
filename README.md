# GALLO: Genomic Annotation in Livestock for positional candidate LOci

The Genomic Annotation in Livestock for positional candidate LOci (GALLO) is an R package designed to provide a straightforward environment for gene and QTL annotation, as well as data integration from multiple data sources. The QTL enrichment analyses can additionally be performed directly by GALLO using the output obtained from the QTL annotation step. In addition, GALLO also provide a set of functions for graphical visualization for the annotation, comparison, integration and QTL enrichment results. Consequently, GALLO is a useful package for the annotation, identification of hidden pattern across datasets, datamining of previous reported associations, as well as the efficient scrutinization of the genetic architecture of complex traits.
