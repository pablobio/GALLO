\alias{plot_overlapping}
\title{Plot overlapping between data and grouping factors}
\usage{
plot_overlapping(overlapping_matrix, nmatrix, ntext, group, labelcex = 1)
}
\arguments{
\item{overlapping_matrix}{The object obtained in overlapping_amoung_groups function}

\item{nmatrix}{An interger from 1 to 3 indicating wich matrix will be used to plot the overlapping, where: 1) A matrix with the number of overllaping data; 2) A matrix with the percentage of overlapping; 3) A matrix with the combination of the two previous one}

\item{ntext}{An interger from 1 to 3 indicating wich matrix will be used as the text matrix for the heatmap, where: 1) A matrix with the number of overllaping data; 2) A matrix with the percentage of overlapping; 3) A matrix with the combination of the two previous one}

\item{group}{A vector with the size of groups. This vector will be plotted as row and column names in the heatmap}

\item{labelcex}{A numeric value indicating the size of the row and column labels}
}
\value{
A heatmap with the overlapping between groups
}
\description{
Takes the output from overlapping_amoung_groups function and creates a heatmap with the overlapping between groups
}
